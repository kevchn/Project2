# MNIST with SVM and CNNs
We try to solve MNIST using SVM (scikit-learn) and CNNs (Pytorch). "The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image." - Professor Yann LeCun.

### Running Code
All code can be run through the jupyter notebooks in src/. Run `jupyter notebook` and open `src/svm.ipynb` and `src/cnn.ipynb` and click the `Run` buttons to execute the code. Reports have been generated in the root directory as *svm.pdf* and *cnn.pdf*.
